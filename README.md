# PwC-Forage-Virtual-Work-Simulation---Business-Intelligence-Using-Power-BI

Overview:
In this Power BI project, I focused on enhancing business intelligence capabilities by creating dynamic dashboards that monitor essential KPIs such as diversity & inclusion, customer demographics, call center efficiency, and overall customer satisfaction. This initiative was aimed at providing actionable insights to improve service delivery, identify at-risk clients among a substantial customer base, and address critical HR issues like gender imbalance at the executive level.

Key Contributions:

Dashboard Development and KPI Definition: I designed and implemented comprehensive Power BI dashboards that visualize key performance indicators crucial for monitoring and improving diversity and inclusion, customer demographics, call center response times, and satisfaction levels. These dashboards serve as vital tools for real-time data analysis, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions promptly.

Customer Segmentation and Risk Identification: Analyzing data from over 7000 customers, I successfully identified 1800+ clients at risk of churn, facilitating targeted interventions. This analysis also highlighted potential opportunities for service plan upgrades, contributing to improved customer retention and revenue growth.

HR Data Analysis for Gender Diversity: I conducted a thorough examination of HR data with a focus on gender-related KPIs. This deep dive into the data helped uncover the underlying reasons for gender disparity within executive management, paving the way for actionable strategies to achieve a more balanced and inclusive workplace.

Technologies Used:

Power BI: Utilized for data visualization, dashboard creation, and advanced analytics to interpret complex data sets and convert them into understandable and actionable insights.

Analytical Techniques: Applied various data analysis methodologies within Power BI to process and analyze HR and customer data, ensuring comprehensive insights into diversity, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

Outcomes and Impact:

The insights gained from the Power BI dashboards have led to targeted strategies aimed at enhancing customer satisfaction, improving diversity and inclusion within the company, and optimizing operational efficiency. Identifying at-risk clients and addressing gender balance issues has not only helped in formulating targeted interventions but also in fostering a more inclusive and customer-centric business environment.

Key Learnings:
The project underscored the importance of leveraging business intelligence tools like Power BI to transform data into strategic assets. It reinforced my expertise in data visualization and the critical role of insightful analytics in driving business strategy, operational improvements, and cultural change.
